### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a French doctopreneur in Data Science and Digital Forensics at [LABEL4.AI](https://www.label4.ai). 

My plan here is to share code and contents that can help as much as possible the forensics community. For the moment, you'll find in my repos some paper studies and implementations but other things are coming. Stay tuned ðŸ˜Ž

If you want to know a bit more about me, feel free to check my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rony-abecidan/).
